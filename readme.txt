This plugin provides WP admin's valuable data from Google Analytics on site without having to login to Google Analytics to get the information.

== Description ==

Google Analytics is a great tool, but requires some technical capabilities to understand it.  This plugin takes some very basic, 
although important, data from Google Analytics (using the Google Analytics export API) and displays the information
on your blog/site to WP administrators or users if you assign them privileges to see it.  The data provided by this plugin is:

*   Pageviews  
*   Average Time On Page  
*   Bounce Rate
*   Exit Rate
*   Referring Sites
*   Keywords

Advanced form tracking capabilities include:

*   Monitor your forms more closely
*   See how long visitors are taking each step of your form
*   See what visitors input into each form regardless of hitting submit
*   Better understand form abandonment

This feature uses Google Analytics Event Tracking to store and retrieve data.
